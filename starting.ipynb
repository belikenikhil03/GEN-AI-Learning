              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/attention.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/attention.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Scaling up the size of language\\nmodels and conducting diversified prompt meth-\\nods become mainstream (Liu et al., 2023c; Wei\\net al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023). Given In-context\\nlearning or Chain-of-Thought prompts have already\\nachieved high performance on challenging tasks\\nsuch as commonsense, arithmetic, and symbolic\\nreasoning (Imani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2021;\\nKojima et al., 2022). Logical reasoning is one of\\nthe most important and long-standing problems in\\nNLP (Hirschberg and Manning, 2015; Russell and\\nNorvig, 2010), and integrating this ability into nat-\\nural language understanding systems has always\\nbeen a goal pursued (Du et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, scaling has been demonstrated\\nto offer limited advantages in resolving complex\\nlogical reasoning issues (Kazemi et al., 2022). For\\nexample, Saparov and He (2022) show that Chain-\\nof-Thought prompting struggles with proof planning\\nfor more complex logical reasoning problems. Addi-\\ntionally, the performance suffers greatly while han-\\ndling recently released and out-of-distribution logi-\\ncal reasoning datasets (Liu et al., 2023a). Despite\\nmany works have explored variants of Chain-of-\\nThought prompts to facilitate LLMs inference (Zelik-\\nman et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), we discover\\nthat the present logical reasoning task prompts\\nplace an excessive amount of emphasis on the\\nreasoning process while ignoring the origin, pur-\\npose, and effectiveness of reasoning (Creswell\\net al., 2022; Xi et al., 2023). As examples shown in\\nQ1: Bob is green. True/false? \\nInput Facts: Alan is blue. Alan is \\nrough. Alan is young. Bob is big. \\nBob is round. Charlie is big. Charlie \\nis blue. Charlie is green. Dave is \\ngreen. Dave is rough.\\nInput Rules: Big people are rough. \\nIf someone is young and round then \\nthey are kind. If someone is round \\nand big then they are blue. All\\nrough people are green.\\nBob is big. \\nBig people are rough. \\nAll rough people are green.\\nAnswer: T\\nQ2: Dave is blue. True/false?\\nLess inspiring\\nFigure 1: Questions in RuleTaker involve logical\\nreasoning with facts and rules.\\nFigure 1, the difficulty in judging logical problems\\narises not only from the process of reasoning but\\nalso from the choice of facts and rules to use as a\\nstarting point. Even if we were provided the thought\\nprocess for some of the issues, it would not be very\\nbeneficial for others, based on how we previously\\ncreated the prompts.\\nIn this paper, we propose Hypothesis Testing\\nPrompting, a new and more considerate prompt\\ntemplate design idea. Hypothesis testing is a for-\\nmal procedure for investigating our ideas about\\nthe world using statistics and is often used by sci-\\nentists to test specific predictions (Bevans, 2022).\\nWe draw inspiration from its process to introduce a\\nprocess of conclusion assumptions, backward rea-\\nsoning, and fact verification. Experiments on Rule-\\nTaker (Clark et al., 2020) and ProofWriter (Tafjord\\net al., 2021) show the effectiveness of our novel\\nprompting paradigm as a strategy for promoting\\ndeductive reasoning in large language models. Fur-\\nther analyses show that Hypothesis Test prompting\\ngenerates more desirable intermediate processes\\narXiv:2405.06707v1  [cs.CL]  9 May 2024\\nand significantly improves the \"Unknown\" label.\\n2.\\nRelated Work\\n2.1.\\nFew-Shot Prompting\\nBrown et al. (2020) propose in-context learning as\\nan alternative few-shot prompting way to stimulate\\nability. Besides, chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,\\n2022b) is one of the most well-known works, which\\ndecomposes the problem into intermediate steps\\nand further improves the ability of large language\\nmodels. Subsequently, several follow-up works\\nwere carried out, including Zero-shot-CoT (simply\\nadding \"Let’s think step by step\" before each an-\\nswer) (Kojima et al., 2022), Self-consistency (Wang\\net al., 2022), complexity-based (Fu et al., 2022),\\nand other prompting work (Liu et al., 2023b; Jung\\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Saparov and He,\\n2022). While these methods enhance the perfor-\\nmance of inference by paying attention to indica-\\ntions of the reasoning process, they often overlook\\nsome aspects such as identifying the root cause of\\nthe problem, establishing efficient reasoning strate-\\ngies, and determining the direction of logical rea-\\nsoning.\\n2.2.\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nDeductive reasoning is defined as the applica-\\ntion of general concepts to particular circum-\\nstances (Johnson-Laird, 2010). Making logical as-\\nsumptions is the foundation of deductive reasoning,\\nwhich then bases a conclusion on those assump-\\ntions. The deduction task is then applied to a sit-\\nuation from the actual world after starting with a\\nrule. In light of the principles \"All men are mortal.\"\\nand \"Socrates is a man.\" for example, we can draw\\nthe conclusion that \"Socrates is mortal.\" (Johnson-\\nLaird, 1999).\\n3.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting\\nHypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investi-\\ngating our ideas about the world using statistics and\\nused by scientists to test specific predictions that\\narise from theories (Bevans, 2022; La et al., 2012).\\nThere are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:\\n1. State your research hypothesis;\\n2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hy-\\npothesis;\\n3. Perform an appropriate statistical test;\\n4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your\\nnull hypothesis;\\n5. Present the findings in your results and discus-\\nsion section;\\nWhen completing a challenging reasoning activ-\\nity, such as a multi-step deductive reasoning prob-\\nlem, one is not conducting random reasoning to\\nobtain all possible intermediate results. We shall\\nchoose the relevant conditions for inference ver-\\nification after initially making assumptions about\\nthe judgment problem, such as \" First assume the\\nconclusion is True and start from ... Then assume\\nthe conclusion is False and start from ... because\\nthe rules state that ... So the conclusion ...\". The\\npurpose of this study is to give language models\\nthe capacity to build a process that is similar to\\nwhat we defined as Hypothesis Testing Prompt-\\ning. We will show that large language models can\\ngenerate more appropriate thought and more ac-\\ncurate results if demonstrations of hypothesis test\\nprompting are provided in the exemplars for few-\\nshot prompting. Figure 2 shows an example of a\\nmodel producing a hypothesis testing thought to\\nsolve a deductive reasoning problem.\\n4.\\nExperiment\\n4.1.\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe explore Hypothesis Test Prompting for Chat-\\nGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo in the OpenAI API) on multiple\\nlogical reasoning benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. Considering FOL reasoning in\\nquestion answering systems, there are two world\\nassumptions (Reiter, 1981) that result in different\\nobjectives. One is the closed world assumption\\n(CWA), which is the presumption that what is not\\ncurrently known to be entailment is contradiction.\\nThe other is the open world assumption (OWA),\\nwhose objective should distinguish false proposi-\\ntions from uncertain ones. Due to differences in\\nworld assumptions, our analysis and solutions are\\nalso different.\\nWe consider the following two deductive reason-\\ning problem benchmarks: (1) the RuleTaker (Clark\\net al., 2020) benchmark using CWA assumption;\\n(2) the ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021) benchmark\\nusing OWA assumption. Both datasets are divided\\ninto five parts, each part requiring 0, ≤1, ≤2, ≤\\n3, and ≤5 hops of reasoning, respectively. We\\nconducted comparison tests on the test set of the\\ntwo datasets for 5 distinct hops.\\nStandard prompting. As one of the baselines,\\nwe take into account the common few-shot prompt-\\ning, made popular by Brown et al. (2020), in which\\na language model is provided with in-context ex-\\namples of input-output pairings before producing a\\nprediction for a test-time example. Examples are\\npresented in the form of questions and answers.\\nAs seen in Figure 2(above), the model directly an-\\nswers the question.\\nChain-of-Thought prompting.

Our proposed\\napproach is to augment each exemplars in few-shot\\nprompting with the thought of hypothesis testing for\\nan associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 2(be-\\nlow).

Five students are required to\\nmanually evaluate the outcomes of the intermediate\\nreasoning after we randomly picked 100 examples\\nfrom depth-5 of the ProofWriter. Proof accuracy rep-\\nresents the proportion where the inference process\\nhas been proven to be reasonable in the correct\\npart of data label prediction. We compare the re-\\nsults of Chian-of-Thought and Hypothesis Testing\\nprompting and report in Figure 4(a). While Hy-\\npothesis Testing prompting mostly produced the\\ncorrect intermediate reasoning process when the\\npredicted label was correct, CoT only generated\\nthe correct chain for 26% of the examples. This\\nresult is in line with other research showing that\\nLMs rely on spurious correlations when solving log-\\nical problems from beginning to end. Additionally,\\nour approach can successfully increase reason-\\ning’s rationality. In processing the \"Unknown\" label,\\nHypothesis Testing prompting performs noticeably\\nbetter than Chain-of-Thought.\\n\"Unknown\" accuracy.\\nIn the ProofWriter\\ndataset, we separately counted the accuracy of\\nthe \"Unknown\" label shown in Figure 4(b). The\\nresults point to a flaw in the Chain-of-Thought strat-\\negy’s handling of \"Unknown\" labels(only 0.3 accu-\\nracyies). Contrarily, Hypothesis Testing prompting\\nsignificantly increases the reliability of judging this\\nlabel (up to 0.65). This further illustrates the value\\nof holding various assumptions, as well as the re-\\nverse confirmation of conclusions.\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nWe have investigated Hypothesis Testing prompt-\\ning as a straightforward and widely applicable tech-\\nnique for improving deductive reasoning in large\\nlanguage models. Multiple assumptions are made\\nduring hypothesis testing, and conclusions are\\nreverse-validated to arrive at the one and only ac-\\ncurate answer. Through experiments on two logical\\nreasoning datasets, we find that Hypothesis Test-\\ning prompting allows large language models to con-\\nstruct reasoning more reasonably and accurately.\\nWe anticipate that additional research on language-\\nbased reasoning approaches will be stimulated by\\nour novel prompting design strategy.\\n6.\\nReferences\\nAlfred V.

While the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to\\nfollow instructions in reasoning tasks), have\\nreceived considerable attention, their abilities\\nin true inductive reasoning remain largely unex-\\nplored.

Surprisingly, de-\\nspite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reason-\\ning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” reasoning.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecent years have witnessed notable progress in\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) with the de-\\nvelopment of Large Language Models (LLMs) like\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and ChatGPT (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023). While these models exhibit impressive\\nreasoning abilities across various tasks, they face\\nchallenges in certain domains. For example, a re-\\ncent study (Wu et al., 2023) has shown that while\\nLLMs excel in conventional tasks (e.g., base-10\\narithmetic), they often experience a notable decline\\nin accuracy when dealing “counterfactual” reason-\\ning tasks that deviate from the conventional cases\\nseen during pre-training (e.g., base-9 arithmetic).\\nIt remains unclear whether they are capable of fun-\\ndamental reasoning, or just approximate retrieval.\\nIn light of this, our paper seeks to investigate\\nthe reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Reasoning\\ncan encompasses two types: deductive reasoning\\nand inductive reasoning, as depicted in Fig. 1. De-\\nductive reasoning starts with a general hypothesis\\nand proceeds to derive specific conclusions about\\nindividual instances while inductive reasoning in-\\nvolves formulating broad generalizations or princi-\\nples from a set of instance observations. Despite\\nextensive research into the reasoning capabilities of\\nLLMs, most studies have not clearly differentiated\\nbetween inductive and deductive reasoning. For in-\\nstance, arithmetic reasoning task primarily focuses\\non comprehending and applying mathematical con-\\ncepts to solve arithmetic problems, aligning more\\nwith deductive reasoning. Yet, when employing\\nin-context learning for arithmetic reasoning tasks,\\nwhere the model is prompted with a few 〈input,\\noutput〉examples, the observed improvements are\\noften attributed to their inductive reasoning capac-\\nity. This fusion of reasoning types poses a critical\\nquestion: Which is the more significant limita-\\ntion in LLM reasoning, deductive or inductive\\nreasoning?\\nTo explore this question, it’s crucial to differen-\\ntiate between deductive and inductive reasoning.\\nCurrent methods that investigate deductive and in-\\nductive reasoning often rely on disparate datasets,\\nmaking direct comparisons challenging (Xu et al.,\\n2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Dalvi et al., 2021; Han\\net al., 2022; Sinha et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). To\\novercome this limitation, we have designed a set of\\ncomparative experiments that utilize a consistent\\ntask across different contexts, each emphasizing\\narXiv:2408.00114v2  [cs.AI]  7 Aug 2024\\n(b) Few-shot IO w/\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(a) Zero-shot\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in\\nbase-8 where the digits are\\n\"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\xa0\\nA:\\n(Output) 71\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nInductive Reasoning\\nGeneral Principle\\nSpecific Conclusion\\nThe result for\\xa036+33 is 71.\\nGeneral\\xa0➔\\xa0Specific\\nDeductive\\nReasoning\\n(c) Few-shot IO w/o\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown,\\xa0what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(d) SolverLearner\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the base of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0What is the function to map the input to the output?\\nA:\\n(Output)\\xa0def solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\\\n # Let\\'s analyze the given examples to find\\nthe base\\\\n # 57 + 27 = 106\\\\n\\xa0# It seems like the base is 8 (octal)\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the\\ninput strings to integers in base 8\\\\n num1 = int(n1, 8)\\\\n num2 = int(n2, 8)\\\\n\\\\n #\\nCalculate the sum\\\\n result = num1 + num2\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the result back to a string in\\nbase 8\\\\n return oct(result)[2:]\\nAddition in base 8\\nBegin from the rightmost digit, perform the addition.

As we move from left\\nto right across the figure, the methods gradually transition their primary focus from deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning.\\nSpecifically, method (a) is designed to demonstrate the LLMs’ deductive reasoning in its pure form. Conversely, method (c)\\nutilizes Input-Output (IO) prompting strategies, which are prevalent for probing the inductive reasoning skills of LLMs. However,\\nwe can observe that methods (c) cannot fully disentangle inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning as their learning process\\ndirectly moves from observations to specific instances, blurring the lines between the two. To exclusively focus on and examine\\ninductive reasoning, we introduce a novel framework called SolverLearner, positioned at the far right of the spectrum.\\neither deductive (i.e., methods (a) and (b)) or induc-\\ntive reasoning (i.e., methods (c) and (d)), as depicted\\nin Fig 1. For instance, in an arithmetic task, the pro-\\nficiency of a LLM in deductive reasoning depends\\non its ability to apply a given input-output mapping\\nfunction to solve problems when this function is\\nexplicitly provided. Conversely, an LLM’s skill\\nin inductive reasoning is measured by its ability\\nto infer these input-output mapping functions (i.e.,\\n𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦), based solely on\\nin-context examples. The base system often serves\\nas the input-output mapping function in an arith-\\nmetic task. In line with the aforementioned setup,\\nwe employ four methods to investigate the reason-\\ning capacity of LLMs. As we move from left to\\nright across Fig. 1, the methods gradually transition\\ntheir primary focus from deductive reasoning to\\ninductive reasoning. Method (a), at the far left of\\nthe figure, aims to explore the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs in its pure form, where no in-\\ncontext-learning examples are provided (zero-shot\\nsettings). While exploring deductive reasoning in\\nits pure form appears relatively straightforward in\\nzero-shot settings, untangling inductive reasoning\\nposes more significant challenges. Recent studies\\nhave investigated the inductive reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gendron et al., 2023;\\nXu et al., 2023b), they have primarily used Input-\\nOutput (IO) prompting (Mirchandani et al., 2023),\\nwhich involves providing models with a few 〈in-\\nput, output〉as demonstrations without providing\\nthe underlying mapping function.\\nThe models\\nare then evaluated based on their ability to han-\\ndle unseen examples, as illustrated in method (c).\\nThese studies often find LLMs facing difficulties\\nwith inductive reasoning. Our research suggests\\nthat the use of IO prompting might not effectively\\nseparate LLMs’ deductive reasoning skills from\\ntheir inductive reasoning abilities. This is because\\nthe approach moves directly from observations to\\nspecific instances, obscuring the inductive reason-\\ning steps. Consequently, the underperformance in\\nthe context of inductive reasoning tasks may be\\nattributed to poor deductive reasoning capabilities,\\ni.e., the ability of LLMs to execute tasks, rather than\\nbeing solely indicative of their inductive reasoning\\ncapability.\\nTo disentangle inductive reasoning from deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we propose a novel model, referred\\nto as SolverLearner. Given our primary focus on in-\\nductive reasoning, SolverLearner follows a two-step\\nprocess to segregate the learning of input-output\\nmapping functions from the application of these\\nfunctions for inference. Specifically, functions are\\napplied through external interpreters, such as code\\ninterpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning.\\nWe evaluate the performance of several LLMs\\nacross various tasks. LLMs consistently demon-\\nstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities\\nthrough SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect per-\\nformance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly,\\ndespite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to exhibit weaker deductive capabilities,\\nparticularly in terms of “counterfactual” reasoning.\\nThis finding, though unexpected, aligns with the\\nprevious research (Wu et al., 2023). In a zero-shot\\nscenario, the ability of an LLM to correctly exe-\\ncute tasks by applying principles (i.e. deductive\\nreasoning) heavily relies on the frequency with\\nwhich the model was exposed to the tasks during\\nits pre-training phase.\\n2\\nTask Definition\\nOur research is focused on a relatively unexplored\\nquestion: Which presents a greater challenge to\\nLLMs - deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning?\\nTo explore this, we designed a set of comparative\\nexperiments that apply a uniform task across var-\\nious contexts, each emphasizing either deductive\\nor inductive reasoning. The primary distinction\\nbetween the deductive and inductive settings is\\nwhether we explicitly present input-output map-\\npings to the models. Informally, we can describe\\nthese mappings as a function 𝑓𝑤: 𝑋→𝑌, where\\nan input 𝑥∈𝑋is transformed into an output 𝑦∈𝑌.\\nWe distinguish between the deductive and inductive\\nsettings as follows:\\n• Deductive setting: we provide the models with\\ndirect input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\n• Inductive setting: we offer the models a few\\nexamples (i.e., (𝑥, 𝑦) pairs) while intentionally\\nleaving out input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\nFor example, consider arithmetic tasks, where the\\nbase system is the input-output mapping function.\\nThe two approaches on the left side of Fig. 1 (i.e.,\\nmethod (a) and (b)) follow the deductive setting,\\nillustrating the case where the arithmetic base is\\nexplicitly provided. In contrast, the two methods\\n(i.e., method (c) and (d)) on right side of Fig. 1\\nadhere to the inductive setting, depicting the sce-\\nnario characterized by the absence of a specified\\narithmetic base, while a few input-output examples\\nare provided for guidance.\\n3\\nOur Framework for Inductive\\nReasoning: SolverLearner\\nWhile recent studies have explored the inductive\\nreasoning abilities of LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gen-\\ndron et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b), they have primar-\\nily relied on Input-Output (IO) prompting (Mirchan-\\ndani et al., 2023). This method involves providing\\nmodels with a few 〈input, output〉demonstrations\\nand then evaluating their performance on unseen\\nexamples, as depicted in method (c) in Fig. 1. Our\\nresearch suggests that the use of IO prompting and\\ndirectly evaluating the final instance performance\\nmight not effectively separate LLMs’ deductive\\nreasoning skills from their inductive reasoning abil-\\nities. This is because the approach moves directly\\nfrom observations to specific instances, obscuring\\nthe inductive reasoning steps. To better disentangle\\ninductive reasoning, we propose a novel framework,\\nSolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to\\nlearn the function (i.e., 𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps in-\\nput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦), using only in-context examples. By\\nfocusing on inductive reasoning and setting aside\\nLLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and\\ninvestigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure\\nform via SolverLearner. SolverLearner includes\\ntwo-stages as illustrated in Fig. 2:\\n• Function Proposal: In this initial phase, we\\npropose a function, that could be used to map\\ninput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦). This is corresponding to the inductive\\nreasoning process.\\n• Function Execution: In the second phase, the\\nproposed function is applied through external\\ncode interpreters to solve the test queries for\\nevaluation purposes. This phase ensures that\\nthe LLM is fully prevented from engaging in\\ndeductive reasoning.\\n3.1\\nFramework\\nIn this subsection, we will take the arithmetic task\\nas a case study to demonstrate the entire process.\\nFunction Proposal: Given the in-context ex-\\namples, the primary goal of LLMs is to learn a\\nfunction that can map input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦). This process of\\nlearning the mapping between inputs and outputs\\nis akin to inductive reasoning, while employing\\nthe learned function to address unseen queries\\naligns with deductive reasoning. In order to sepa-\\nrate inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning,\\nthe execution of the learned function should be\\ncompletely detached from LLMs. To achieve this\\nseparation, external tools such as code interpreters\\nserve as efficient way to execute these functions in-\\ndependently. By encapsulating the learned function\\nwithin Python code, we can effectively detach the\\nduty of deductive reasoning from LLMs, assigning\\nThe result for 71+44 is 135.\\nThe result for 42+70 is 132.\\nThe result for 50+45 is 115.\\nThe result for 61+55 is 136.\\nThe result for 63+22 is 105.\\nThe result for 72+62 is 154.\\nThe result for 57+27 is 106.\\nThe result for 52+76 is 150.\\n8 Shot Examples\\nPython\\xa0Function\\n14+57\\n44+45\\n...\\n61+23\\n22+77\\nTest Queries\\n②\\xa0Function\\xa0\\nExecution\\n① Function\\nProposal\\nFigure 2: An overview of our framework SolverLearner for inductive reasoning. SolverLearner follows a two-step process to\\nsegregate the learning of input-output mapping functions from the application of these functions for inference. Specifically,\\nfunctions are applied through external code interpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\nit solely to these external executors. For instance,\\nin function proposal stage for an arithmetic task,\\nwe have:\\n“You are an expert mathematician and program-\\nmer. You are asked to add two numbers, the base\\nof which is unknown. Below are some provided\\nexamples: The result for 76+76 is 174.\\nPlease identify the underlying pattern to determine\\nthe base being used and implement a solver() func-\\ntion to achieve the goal.\\ndef solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\n# Let’s write a Python program step by step\\n# Each input is a number represented as a string.\\n# The function computes the sum of these numbers\\nand returns it as a string. ”\\nFunction Execution: In the second phase, func-\\ntions are executed through external code interpreters\\nto solve the test cases for evaluation purposes. These\\ncode interpreters act as “oracle” deductive reason-\\ners, fully preventing the LLM from involving deduc-\\ntive reasoning. This ensures that the final results\\nreflect only the inductive reasoning capability of the\\nLLM. To further decouple the LLM’s influence in\\nthis phase, test cases are generated using a template\\nwithout involving the LLM. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.1.3.\\n4\\nTasks\\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the\\ntasks under consideration. Our focus is on inves-\\ntigating the reasoning abilities of LLMs in both\\ndeductive and inductive reasoning scenarios. To\\nensure a robust evaluation, we carefully select tasks\\nthat lend themselves well to comparison. Firstly, to\\nprevent LLMs from reciting tasks seen frequently\\nduring pre-training, which could artificially inflate\\nperformance in deductive reasoning, a significant\\nportion of the tasks falls into the category of “coun-\\nterfactual reasoning” tasks. Secondly, in the context\\nof inductive reasoning, where only a few in-context\\nexamples are available without the mapping func-\\ntion, our objective is to learn the function that\\nmaps inputs to outputs based on this restricted\\ndataset. To achieve this, we choose tasks that are\\nwell-constrained, ensuring the existence of a single,\\nunique function capable of fitting this limited data.\\nDetailed descriptions of each task and the prompts\\nused can be found in Appendix A.1 and A.2.\\nArithmetic In this study, we focus on the two-\\ndigit addition task previously explored in the work\\nof\\nWu et al. (2023).\\nWe investigate multiple\\nnumerical bases, specifically base-8, 9, 10, 11, and\\n16 where base 10 corresponds to the commonly\\nobserved case during pretraining. In the context of\\ndeductive reasoning, the base is explicitly provided\\nwithout any accompanying in-context examples,\\nand the LLM is expected to perform the addition\\ncomputation by relying on its inherent deductive\\nreasoning abilities. Conversely, in the context of\\ninductive reasoning, instead of explicitly providing\\nthe base information to LLMs, we provide LLMs\\nsolely with few-shot examples and require them\\nto induce the base through these examples and\\nsubsequently generate a function to solve arithmetic\\nproblems.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In this setting, we\\nconcentrate on tasks related to syntactic recognition\\npreviously explored by Wu et al. (2023). Our\\nobjective is to evaluate LLMs using artificially\\nconstructed English sentences that vary from the\\nconventional subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.\\nFor deductive reasoning, we directly provide the\\nnew word order to LLMs without any contextual\\nexamples, challenging them to identify the subject,\\nverb, and object within this artificial language. In\\ncontrast, for inductive reasoning, we do not give\\nexplicit instructions on the changes in word order.\\nInstead, we introduce sentence pairs where one\\nsentence follows the standard word order, and the\\nother follows a modified sequence. Through this\\nsetting, LLMs are expected to learn the specific\\nchanges made to the word order and then apply this\\nlearned rule to identify the subject, verb, and object\\nwithin new sentences.\\nSpatial Reasoning In this task, we investigate\\nthe spatial reasoning previously investigated by Wu\\net al. (2023). Our specific focus is on modifying\\nthe direction-unit vector mapping and determining\\nthe object coordinates in this revised system. We\\nexplore multiple systems, starting with the com-\\nmonly observed case during pretraining, where up\\ncorresponds to north, down to south, left to west,\\nand right to east. This is compared to coordinate\\nsystems with swapped, rotated, and randomly per-\\nmuted axes. For deductive reasoning, we directly\\nprovide the direction-unit vector mapping without\\nany contextual examples, requiring LLMs to com-\\npute the object coordinates within these systems.\\nConversely, in the context of inductive reasoning, in-\\nstead of directly explaining the changes made to the\\ndirection-unit vector mapping to LLMs, we present\\nLLMs with a few example shots and challenge them\\nto infer the changes made to the mapping. They\\nare then expected to apply this learned function to\\ndetermine the object coordinates in the system.\\nCipher Decryption Under this scenario, we ex-\\nplore an innovative task that we have created, con-\\ncentrating on the decryption of strings encrypted\\nusing specific cipher systems. We have incorpo-\\nrated three particular cipher systems for this ex-\\nploration: the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. For deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we directly inform LLMs about the\\ncipher system being used, yet we do not offer any\\ncontextual examples. The objective for LLMs is to\\ndecode strings according to these cipher systems.\\nConversely, in the inductive reasoning scenario, our\\ntask involves providing LLMs with several exam-\\nples, each consisting of an encrypted string and\\nits decrypted version. The main challenge for the\\nmodels in this scenario is first to identify what ci-\\npher system was used and then to apply that cipher\\nsystem to decrypt an unseen string.\\n5\\nResults\\nFor each task, we evaluate our proposed Solver-\\nLearner for pure LLM inductive reasoning and\\nother settings using two different models, gpt-3.5-\\nturbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview, which are de-\\nnoted as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively. Since\\nboth methods are closed-source, we do not provide\\nspecific information about their size, architecture,\\nand pre-training particulars. Our experiments pri-\\nmarily focus on investigating the reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs in both deductive and inductive reasoning\\nscenarios. Therefore, we structure our evaluation\\nacross two distinct settings to highlight each type\\nof reasoning. The formal definition of each setting\\nis provided in Sec. 2. For the deductive setting, two\\nmethods are proposed for investigation:\\n• Zero-shot evaluates deductive reasoning ability\\nof the LLMs in its pure form. It tests the LLM’s\\nability to conclude information about specific\\nindividuals based solely on instructions, without\\nrelying on examples.\\n• 8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF) follows the\\ndeductive setting but enhances LLM reasoning\\nfurther by incorporating in-context examples. It\\naligns with the most commonly used prompt\\nmethods for enabling LLM reasoning. With the\\ninclusion of in-context examples, this approach\\ncan be seen as leveraging inductive reasoning to\\naugment deductive reasoning.\\nFor the inductive setting, we propose two methods\\nfor evaluation:\\n• 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) aligns with\\ntraditional input-output (IO) prompting methods\\nwidely used to investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapability of LLMs. However, as this method\\nproceeds directly from a set of observations to\\nspecific target instances, it remains intertwined\\nwith LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\n• 8-shot SolverLearner corresponds to our pro-\\nposed framework for inductive reasoning, capable\\nof evaluating inductive reasoning ability of the\\nLLMs in its pure form. It segregates the learning\\nof input-output mapping functions from the ap-\\nplication of these functions for inference, thereby\\npreventing the blend of LLM-based deductive\\nreasoning into the process.\\nBesides using 8-shot examples, our study also in-\\ncludes experiments with 16-shot examples to assess\\nhow changes in the number of in-context examples\\nimpact the results.

Fur-\\nthermore, we conduct an ablation study concerning\\nour proposed SolverLearner in Appendix A.5 for\\ndeeper insights into its functionality.\\n5.1\\nMain Results\\nThe results for all tasks are presented from Fig. 3\\nthrough Fig. 5. Specifically, Fig. 3 concentrates on\\ncomparing performances in the deductive setting,\\nwhile Fig. 4 examines comparisons in the inductive\\nsetting. Additionally, Fig. 5 focuses on contrasting\\nthe models’ capabilities across deductive and induc-\\ntive setting. For further reference, the prompts used\\nfor all tasks are included in Appendix A.2, and the\\nfull numerical results can be found in Appendix A.3.\\nLLMs exhibit poor deductive reasoning capa-\\nbilities, particularly in “counterfactual” tasks.\\nWe include two methods in Fig. 3, Zero-shot and\\n8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate the\\ndeductive reasoning capability of LLMs. Our obser-\\nvations reveal that LLMs exhibit relatively weaker\\ndeductive capabilities, especially in “counterfac-\\ntual” tasks, while showing prowers in standard\\ntasks like base-10 arithmetic.\\nThis aligns with\\nfindings reported in (Wu et al., 2023). Integration\\nof in-context examples notably enhances LLMs’\\nperformance in various scenarios, suggesting that\\ntheir improvement stems from the acquisition of\\nknowledge through inductive reasoning from these\\nexamples. This further confirms the exceptional\\ninductive reasoning abilities of LLMs. This com-\\nbined evidence suggests that LLMs face challenges\\nin precisely following instructions and executing\\ncommands, especially when those instructions are\\nrelate to scenarios rarely encountered during their\\npre-training phase.\\nLLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive rea-\\nsoning capabilities through SolverLearner. We\\ninclude two methods in Fig. 4, SolverLearner (Ours)\\nand 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate\\nthe inductive reasoning capability of LLMs. While\\n8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) struggles with\\ninductive reasoning, SolverLearner consistently\\nachieves perfect performance with an accuracy of\\n1 across all the cases with GPT-4 and succeeds in\\nmost cases when used with GPT-3.5. This discrep-\\nancy arises because the utilization of IO prompting\\nto directly reach conclusions on target instances may\\nnot effectively distinguish between LLMs’ deduc-\\ntive and inductive reasoning skills. By completely\\ndisentangling the inductive reasoning of LLMs,\\nour proposed SolverLearner shows the remarkable\\ninductive reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.\\nIt is also noteworthy that the efficacy of LLMs’\\ninductive reasoning capability heavily depends on\\nthe foundational model, with GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforming GPT-3.5.\\nDeductive reasoning presents a greater chal-\\nlenge than inductive reasoning for LLMs. To\\ncompare the challenges of the deductive reasoning\\ncapability with the inductive reasoning capability\\nof LLMs, we include two methods in Fig. 1, Solver-\\nLearner and Zero-shot, demonstrating pure induc-\\ntive and deductive reasoning abilities. Since the\\nentire reasoning involves two steps: first, obtaining\\nthe input-output function ( 𝑓𝑤), which corresponds\\nto inductive reasoning, and second, applying the\\nfunction for inference, which corresponds to deduc-\\ntive reasoning. Once both steps are successfully\\ncompleted, perfect performance is observed, as\\nindicated by the dotted line in the figure. Zero-\\nshot can be seen as replacing the first step with\\nan oracle, with deductive reasoning capability of\\nLLMs to be studied, while SolverLearner can be\\nseen as replacing the second step with an oracle,\\nwith inductive reasoning capability of LLMs to be\\nstudied. By comparing the gaps of SolverLearner\\nand Zero-shot towards perfect reasoning, we can\\nobserve that in most cases, LLMs can complete the\\ninductive step perfectly, while they rarely achieve\\nperfect performance on the deductive step. This in-\\ndicates that in LLM reasoning, deductive reasoning\\npresents a greater challenge. Note that we avoid to\\nphrasing it as directly comparing inductive and de-\\nductive reasoning capabilities. Instead, we examine\\nwhether the gaps mainly come from inductive or\\ninductive reasoning, considering that LLMs could\\nnot achieve perfect counterfactual reasoning.\\n5.2\\nMore Results over Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclusion,\\nwe have included results over additional LLMs,\\nclaude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted\\nas Claude3.\\nDue to space limitations, the full\\nnumerical results are provided in Appendix A.4.\\n5.3\\nAblation Study\\nWe conducted several experiments to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of our framework, detailed in the ab-\\nlation studies in Appendix A.5. These experiments\\ninclude investigating the effects of programs exe-\\ncuted by a Python interpreter v.s. natural language\\nexecuted by an LLM and examining the impact of\\nthe number of in-context learning examples.\\n6\\nRelated Works\\n6.1\\nIn-Context Learning\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has demonstrated its\\neffectiveness in learning from a few demonstration\\nexamples and solve previously unseen tasks with-\\nout requiring updates to its model parameters (Wei\\net al., 2022a). This remarkable capability is com-\\nmonly referred to as the “in-context learning ability”\\nof language models. It implies that the LLMs can\\nleverage its existing knowledge and generalize from\\na few demonstration examples to solve new, related\\ntasks (Dong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Rubin et al.,\\n2021; Gonen et al., 2022). Some notable works\\ninclude chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei\\net al., 2022b), which elicits reasoning with inter-\\nmediate steps in few-shot exemplars. Built upon\\nthe CoT framework, several works expand CoT by\\norganizing and processing thoughts using more\\ncomplex structures, such as trees (Yao et al., 2023)\\nand graphs (Besta et al., 2023) or breaking a prob-\\nlem into sub problems and then proceeds to solve\\neach one independently (Zhou et al., 2022). While\\nthese studies have effectively improved the reason-\\ning capability of LLMs, they have failed to clearly\\ndistinguish between inductive and deductive reason-\\ning, let alone investigate which represents a more\\ncritical limitation for LLM reasoning capabilities:\\ndeductive reasoning or inductive reasoning.\\n6.2\\nExploring LLMs’ Reasoning Skills\\nDespite the impressive achievements of LLMs in\\nvarious reasoning tasks, the underlying mechanisms\\nof their reasoning capabilities remain a subject of\\ndebate. The question of whether LLMs genuinely\\nreason in a manner akin to human cognitive pro-\\ncesses or merely simulate aspects of reasoning\\nwithout true comprehension is still open (Huang\\nand Chang, 2022).\\nFor instance, Kojima et al.\\nhave suggested that LLMs exhibit commendable\\nzero-shot reasoning abilities, implying that these\\nmodels can draw logical conclusions in scenarios\\nthey have not been explicitly trained on (Kojima\\net al., 2022). However, some researchers cast doubt\\non the reasoning capability of LLMs. While ap-\\nproaches like the chain-of-thought method may\\nmimic human-like thought processes, it remains\\nuncertain whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in\\nreasoning or simply following patterns learned dur-\\ning training (Wei et al., 2022b; Valmeekam et al.,\\n2022). Additionally, there’s a debate regarding\\nwhether LLMs are symbolic reasoners (Tang et al.,\\n2023) or possess strong abstract reasoning capa-\\nbilities (Gendron et al., 2023). In light of these\\nseemingly contradictory conclusions, our research\\naims to investigate deeper into the reasoning capa-\\nbilities of LLMs. We intend to dissect the nuances\\nof inductive and deductive reasoning within the\\ncontext of LLMs, identifying which form of reason-\\ning presents a more significant challenge to their\\nreasoning abilities.\\n6.3\\nEquipping LLMs with External Tools\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have made signifi-\\ncant progress in utilizing tools through frameworks\\nlike CREATOR (Qian et al., 2023) and LATM (Cai\\net al., 2023), which allow LLMs to create tools\\nusing documentation and code. Logic-LM (Pan\\net al., 2023) integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers\\nto improve logical problem-solving, However, these\\napproaches focus exclusively on deductive reason-\\ning, aiming to enable LLMs to derive correct an-\\nswers for specific questions without incorporating\\nthe capacity for inductive reasoning to infer underly-\\ning mapping function shared by few-shot examples.\\nIn contrast, our primary objective is not to propose\\na new framework for using tools to enhance the\\nproblem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Instead, we\\naim to differentiate between deductive and inductive\\nreasoning within LLMs and explore which presents\\na greater challenge to their reasoning abilities.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nThis study aims to explore a less-investigated aspect\\nof LLMs: within LLM reasoning, which presents\\na greater challenge — deductive or inductive rea-\\nsoning?\\nTo investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapacities of LLMs, we introduce a novel frame-\\nwork called SolverLearner. By concentrating on\\ninductive reasoning while setting aside LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning, SolverLearner can scrutinize\\nthe pure form of inductive reasoning in LLMs.\\nOur findings unveil remarkable inductive reasoning\\nprowers in LLMs through SolverLearner, achieving\\nnear-perfect performance with an ACC of 1 in most\\ncases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive\\nreasoning abilities, LLMs often exhibit weaker de-\\nductive capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” scenarios.\\nLimitations\\nLLMs cannot perform inductive reasoning over\\nall the tasks In our inductive learning setting, LLMs\\nare provided with only a limited number of contex-\\ntual examples. The goal is to infer the function that\\naccurately maps inputs to outputs based solely on\\nthis constrained dataset. In order to solve this prob-\\nlem, it is significant that we can find a unique func-\\ntion satisfied given these examples. For instance, a\\nlinear function can be precisely determined given\\njust two data points, as it has a singular solution.\\nHowever, attempting to deduce a quadratic curve\\nfrom two points poses an insurmountable challenge\\ndue to the existence of infinite functions capable\\nof passing through those specific points. Addition-\\nally, LLMs might struggle to discern the correct\\nmapping function when the search space of the\\nproblem expands excessively. Consider the case\\nof arithmetic tasks; without limiting the search\\nspace to finding a suitable base that aligns with\\nthe observations, the task becomes overwhelmingly\\ncomplex. This is because the search space could en-\\ncompass any conceivable rule that accommodates\\nthe observations.\\nThe effectiveness of LLMs’ inductive reason-\\ning capability is heavily reliant on the founda-\\ntional model While GPT-4 consistently showcase\\nimpressive inductive reasoning abilities through\\nSolverLearner and achieve perfect performance\\nwith ACC of 1 across all the tasks, GPT-3.5 strug-\\ngle to learn the correct input-output mapping func-\\ntion in several cases. This observation suggests\\nthat the inductive reasoning potential of LLMs is\\nsignificantly constrained by the underlying model.\\nChain of Thought (COT) has not been incor-\\nporated into the comparison Chain of Thought\\n(COT) is a significant prompting technique designed\\nfor use with LLMs. Rather than providing a direct\\nanswer, COT elicits reasoning with intermediate\\nsteps in few-shot exemplars. This method was not\\nincorporated into our comparison as it is viewed\\nas a technique to improve the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs. Although COT has proven to\\nbe effective across various tasks, numerous studies\\nhighlight a significant performance gap that COT\\nstill needs to bridge to achieve flawless execution.\\nEthical Considerations\\nThe authors foresee no ethical concerns with the\\nresearch presented in this paper.\\nReferences\\nMaciej Besta, Nils Blach, Ales Kubicek, Robert Ger-\\nstenberger, Lukas Gianinazzi, Joanna Gajda, Tomasz\\nLehmann, Michal Podstawski, Hubert Niewiadomski,\\nPiotr Nyczyk, et al. 2023.

These expressions are\\ndrawn from bases 8, 9, 10, 11, and 16, with sepa-\\nrate sampling for each base. Importantly, all the\\nexpressions have been carefully chosen to yield\\ndistinct results when evaluated in their respective\\nbases, thereby distinguishing them from one another\\nduring the process of rule learning.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In accordance with\\nthe methodology outlined in Wu et al.’s work (Wu\\net al., 2023), we have generated a set of 100 simple\\nthree-word sentences (e.g., “bob likes bananas”)\\nwith five different word order variations (e.g., “ba-\\nnanas bob likes” in OSV format). Subsequently,\\nwe tasked LLMs with learning how to manipulate\\nsentence order. It’s noteworthy that we took great\\ncare in selecting words to ensure that each word in\\na sentence can only fulfill one specific role, such as\\nsubject, object, or verb. For instance, we ensured\\nthat sentences like “bob likes anna” were excluded,\\nas both “bob” and “anna” could potentially serve as\\nboth subjects and objects, violating this constraint.\\nSpatial Reasoning The spatial reasoning dataset\\nintroduced in Wu et al.’s paper (Wu et al., 2023)\\nconsists of 100 rooms that were randomly selected,\\nand each room contains three distinct objects. The\\nspatial directions within these rooms are represented\\nusing unit vectors. For instance, north is represented\\nas (0, 1), south as (0, -1), east as (1, 0), and west\\nas (-1, 0), with a y-axis pointing upward serving\\nas the default orientation. In our study, we have\\nmodified the mapping between directions and unit\\nvectors and tasked LLMs with learning this new\\ndirection-to-unit vector relationship. We explore\\ntwo direction-swapped scenarios (north-south and\\neast-west), three rotated scenarios (by 90°, 180°,\\nand 270°), and a randomly permuted scenario. The\\nprimary metric we report is instance-level accuracy,\\nwhich necessitates that all three objects within a\\nroom must be correctly positioned in order to be\\nconsidered accurate.\\nCipher Decryption We’ve generated a collection\\nof 100 pairs of strings (e.g., “Mrxuqhb -> Journey”\\nfor Caesar Cipher) for each of three cipher systems,\\nincluding the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. Each pair\\ncomprises an encrypted string (e.g., “Mrxuqhb”)\\nand its corresponding decrypted version (e.g., “Jour-\\nney”). By providing LLMs with several examples,\\neach containing an encrypted string alongside its\\ncorresponding decrypted counterpart, the primary\\ntask is to accurately determine the cipher system\\nemployed in an open-world context.\\nA.1.2\\nFew shot Example Generation\\nThe preparation of examples for few-shot learning\\nfollows a straightforward process. We divide all the\\ndata into a training set and a test set, from which few-\\nshot examples are extracted from the training set.\\nThese few-shot examples are automatically prepared\\nby associating queries with their corresponding\\nground truth answers using a pre-defined template.\\nA.1.3\\nTest Case Generation\\nIn the function execution phase, the test cases are\\ngenerated using a template without involving LLM.\\nIn particular, the test cases are drawn from the test\\ndata files, containing all the queries along with\\ntheir correct answers (e.g., “76+76 = 174”). When\\nthe LLM is used for generating code, we specify\\na function interface, such as def solver(n1: str,\\nn2: str) -> str. Then, using the query examples\\nprovided, like “76+76 = 174”, we create test cases\\nby applying this function interface to the query (e.g.,\\nsolver(76,76)), thereby eliminating any reliance on\\nLLM for this process. This method ensures that our\\ntest case generation is 100% correct.\\nA.2\\nFull Prompts\\nWe provide the prompts that we used to query the\\nLLMs for all tasks in Tables 1 to 4. We do not use\\nthe system message field for any model.\\nA.3\\nFull Results\\nWe show the full numerical results in Tables 5 to 8.\\nIn addition to using 8-shot examples, these results\\nalso include experiments with 16-shot examples\\nto assess how changes in the number of in-context\\nexamples impact the results.\\nA.4\\nMore Results on Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclu-\\nsion, we have included additional LLMs, claude-\\n3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted as\\nClaude3. We show the full numerical results in\\nTables 9 to 12.\\nA.5\\nAblation studies\\nLLMs struggle as executors when applying\\nlearned functions. To better demonstrate the de-\\nductive capacity of LLM, we present both GPT-3.5\\nand Python with identical code and task them with\\napplying the code to deduce the same set of queries.\\nAs shown in Table 13, while the Python interpreter\\ncan be considered an oracle, delivering flawless\\nperformance, it proves challenging for LLMs to\\naccurately execute the code.\\nLLMs can learn the function with very few\\nexamples when the inductive reasoning problem\\nis well defined.\\nTo examine the impact of the\\nnumber of few-shot examples on the inductive rea-\\nsoning capability of LLMs, we vary the number of\\nin-context examples within [1,2,4,8,16] and assess\\nperformance on the spatial reasoning task using\\nGPT-3.5 as presented in Table 14. We observe that\\neven with very few examples, GPT-3.5 can still\\nlearn the mapping function if it is learnable.\\nTable 1: Prompts for the Arithmetic Task.\\nMode\\nPrompt\\nZero-shot\\nYou are a mathematician.
